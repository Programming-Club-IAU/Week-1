## Project: Create a Simple Website

Description: You will create a simple static website with a few pages and use Git and GitHub to manage the project's version control.
Tasks:
**1. Setup:**

- Set up Git on your local machine if you haven't already.
- Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
- Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

**2. Initial Commit:**

- Go to the folder where you cloned the repository.
- Inside the folder, create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and add some basic content.
- Add the HTML file to the repository using `git add`.
- Commit the changes using `git commit`.

**3. Branching:**

- Create a new branch named "feature" using `git branch feature`.
- Switch to the "feature" branch using `git checkout feature`.
- Make some changes to the HTML file in the "feature" branch, like adding a new page or modifying existing content.

**4. Merging:**

- Switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main`.
- Merge the changes from the "feature" branch into the main branch using `git merge feature`.

**5. Pull Requests:**

- Go to the GitHub repository.
- Create a new Pull Request (PR) to merge the "feature" branch into the main branch.
- Add a description for the PR.
- Review the changes and create the PR.

**6. Collaboration (Optional):**

- Invite a friend to collaborate on the project by adding them as a collaborator on the GitHub repository.
- Have your friend clone the repository, create a branch, make changes, and create a Pull Request as well.
- Review and merge their changes into the main branch.
